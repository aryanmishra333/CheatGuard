# Advanced Anti-Cheat Proctoring System

## üõ°Ô∏è **Enhanced Security Against Sophisticated Cheating**

Your concern about eye-only cheating is absolutely valid! I've significantly enhanced the system with **advanced anti-cheat measures** that can detect even the most sophisticated cheating attempts.

## üéØ **Cheating Scenarios Now Detected**

### **1. Eye-Only Movement Cheating**
- **Scenario**: Student keeps head still but moves only eyes to look at notes/phone
- **Detection**: Advanced pupil tracking with precise deviation analysis
- **Alert**: "ANTI-CHEAT ALERT: Suspicious eye movement detected!"

### **2. Scanning Pattern Detection**
- **Scenario**: Student rapidly scans left-right-left-right looking for answers
- **Detection**: Pattern analysis of eye movement variance
- **Alert**: Detects oscillating movement patterns

### **3. Rapid Eye Movement**
- **Scenario**: Quick darting eye movements to check multiple sources
- **Detection**: Eye movement velocity tracking
- **Alert**: Flags movements faster than normal reading patterns

### **4. Sustained Off-Center Gaze**
- **Scenario**: Student maintains eyes off-center for extended periods
- **Detection**: Continuous monitoring of pupil position relative to screen center
- **Alert**: Detects prolonged off-center viewing

## üî¨ **Advanced Detection Methods**

### **Method 1: Enhanced Pupil Tracking**
```python
# Precise pupil center calculation
pupil_center_x = (l_cx + r_cx) / 2
pupil_center_y = (l_cy + r_cy) / 2

# Deviation from screen center
horizontal_deviation = pupil_center_x - screen_center_x
vertical_deviation = pupil_center_y - screen_center_y

# Eye-only movement detection
eye_looking_left = horizontal_deviation < -PUPIL_DEVIATION_THRESHOLD
eye_looking_right = horizontal_deviation > PUPIL_DEVIATION_THRESHOLD
```

### **Method 2: Eye Movement Pattern Analysis**
```python
# Movement velocity tracking
movement_distance = ((current_center[0] - prev_center[0])**2 + 
                   (current_center[1] - prev_center[1])**2)**0.5

# Pattern recognition
x_variance = np.var(x_positions)  # Horizontal movement variance
y_variance = np.var(y_positions)  # Vertical movement variance

# Scanning pattern detection
if x_variance > 400 and y_variance < 100:
    suspicious_movement = True
    movement_type = "scanning_pattern"
```

### **Method 3: Multi-Frame Analysis**
- **Pupil History**: Tracks last 5 frames of eye positions
- **Movement Smoothing**: Reduces false positives from camera noise
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each detection has a confidence level (0.0-1.0)

## üö® **Detection Types**

| Detection Type | Description | Confidence | Alert Type |
|----------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| `high_deviation` | Pupils significantly off-center | 0.9 | Anti-Cheat |
| `rapid_movement` | Fast eye movements | 0.8 | Anti-Cheat |
| `scanning_pattern` | Left-right scanning | 0.7 | Anti-Cheat |
| `sustained_off_center` | Prolonged off-center gaze | 0.8 | Anti-Cheat |
| `eye_only_left/right/up` | Eye movement without head movement | 0.7 | Anti-Cheat |

## üìä **Real-Time Monitoring**

### **Screen Display**
```
Gaze: SUSPICIOUS_SCANNING_PATTERN (SUSPICIOUS)  ‚Üê Yellow text
ANTI-CHEAT ALERT!                               ‚Üê Yellow alert
Violations: 3                                   ‚Üê Total violations
Suspicious: 15                                  ‚Üê Suspicious movements
Proctoring: ON                                  ‚Üê System status
```

### **Console Alerts**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  SUSPICIOUS EYE MOVEMENT DETECTED: scanning_pattern (Count: 15)
üö® ANTI-CHEAT ALERT: Suspicious eye movement detected! (Violation #3)
```

## üéÆ **Enhanced Controls**

| Key | Function | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `c` | Calibrate | Set current head position as "forward" |
| `r` | Record | Start/Stop data logging |
| `p` | Proctoring | Toggle system ON/OFF |
| `v` | Violations | Reset violation count |
| `s` | Suspicious | Reset suspicious movements count |
| `q` | Quit | Exit program |

## üìà **Data Logging Enhancements**

### **New CSV Columns**
- **Cheat Detected**: Boolean flag for cheating attempts
- **Suspicious Movements**: Count of suspicious eye movements
- **Eye Movement Velocity**: Speed of eye movements in pixels/frame

### **Sample Log Entry**
```csv
Timestamp,Left_Eye_X,Left_Eye_Y,Right_Eye_X,Right_Eye_Y,...,Gaze_Direction,Violation_Detected,Cheat_Detected,Suspicious_Movements,Eye_Movement_Velocity
1623447890123,315,225,227,68,...,suspicious_scanning_pattern,True,True,15,25.4
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Parameters**

```python
# Anti-Cheat Settings
PUPIL_DEVIATION_THRESHOLD = 30    # Pixels - threshold for pupil deviation
EYE_MOVEMENT_SMOOTHING = 5        # Frames for smoothing
GAZE_ALERT_DURATION = 10          # Seconds before violation alert

# Detection Thresholds
RAPID_MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD = 20     # Pixels/frame for rapid movement
SCANNING_VARIANCE_THRESHOLD = 400 # Variance threshold for scanning
SUSPICIOUS_MOVEMENT_LIMIT = 10    # Count before alert
```

## üß™ **Testing Anti-Cheat Features**

### **Test 1: Eye-Only Cheating**
1. Look straight ahead and calibrate with 'c'
2. Keep head still, move only eyes left/right
3. Watch for "ANTI-CHEAT ALERT" messages

### **Test 2: Scanning Pattern**
1. Rapidly scan eyes left-right-left-right
2. System should detect scanning pattern
3. Check suspicious movements counter

### **Test 3: Sustained Off-Center**
1. Look slightly off-center for extended period
2. System should detect sustained deviation
3. Monitor confidence levels

## üîß **Tuning for Your Environment**

### **Adjust Sensitivity**
```python
# More sensitive (catches more cheating, may have false positives)
PUPIL_DEVIATION_THRESHOLD = 20

# Less sensitive (fewer false positives, may miss subtle cheating)
PUPIL_DEVIATION_THRESHOLD = 40
```

### **Camera Positioning**
- **Distance**: 50-70cm from face
- **Height**: Eye level or slightly above
- **Lighting**: Even, bright lighting for accurate pupil detection
- **Angle**: Straight-on view, not angled

## üéØ **Effectiveness Against Cheating**

### **‚úÖ Detects:**
- Eye-only movements (head still, eyes moving)
- Scanning patterns (left-right-left-right)
- Rapid eye movements
- Sustained off-center gaze
- Peripheral vision cheating attempts
- Quick glances at off-screen content

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:**
- Requires good lighting for accurate pupil detection
- May have false positives with very fast head movements
- Needs proper camera positioning
- May not detect very subtle eye movements

## üöÄ **Future Enhancements**

1. **Machine Learning**: Train on user-specific normal patterns
2. **Behavioral Analysis**: Learn individual eye movement patterns
3. **Multi-Camera**: Use multiple angles for better detection
4. **Sound Alerts**: Audio notifications for violations
5. **Web Dashboard**: Remote monitoring interface
